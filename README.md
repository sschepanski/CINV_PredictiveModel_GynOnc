# CINV Prediction Model for Gynecological Oncology Patients

## Introduction

This project focuses on the development of a predictive model for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in patients with gynecological cancers. CINV is a common and distressing side effect that impacts patient quality of life and treatment adherence. While antiemetic guidelines help mitigate CINV, individual patient responses vary widely, influenced by numerous patient-related factors. This study aims to create a CINV risk model that incorporates these patient-specific factors, ultimately assisting clinicians in selecting personalized antiemetic prophylaxis strategies. The model is based on data from a multicenter, observational study with machine learning and statistical modeling techniques used to identify key predictive factors.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model for CINV risk in gynecological cancer patients, leveraging both clinical and patient-reported factors to identify high-risk individuals. This model is intended to guide clinicians in selecting tailored antiemetic treatments, thereby improving patient outcomes and quality of life during chemotherapy.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains the dataset used in the analysis.
- **`scr/`**: Python and Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and results preparation.
- **`models/`**: Stores the trained models and associated output files.

## Scripts

1. **EMRISK_Prediction.ipynb**: This notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of patient-related CINV risk factors, including data exploration, preprocessing, feature selection, and model development using machine learning techniques such as XGBoost and logistic regression.
